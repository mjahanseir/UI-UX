For a good starting point for evaluating if a UX design is efficient, the research company Nielsen Norman Group defines usability through these 5 characteristics:

Learn-ability: Can the user complete their tasks with little or no difficulty?
Efficiency: Does the interface allow the user to complete tasks in a timely manner?
Memorability: After leaving a website, how likely will the user be able to remember how to use it the next time they visit?
Errors: What steps does the interface take to lessen the chance of user error, and how do they let the users correct an error?
Satisfaction: Does the user enjoy interacting with the design?

On top of those standards, a good UX should also reflect the personality of the brand in order to stand out from the competition and provide users with a delightful experience.

From this point of view, the following characteristics should be taken into consideration:

Stunning and unique layout: Even for visitors who fail to stay, a great layout can make your website unforgettable. They might return because your products are laid out with creativity rather than being displayed in the old-fashioned grids.
High-quality images: photos are the most eye-catching features that visitors see from the first glance on your website. Remarkable sites compete to cover their high-resolution image pages to expose their products from many angles.
Thought-provoking slogans: Clever content providers and UX designers create and put thought-provoking slogans everywhere on their homepages from sliders, headers to landing pages and pop-up forms.
Straightforward navigation: This idea is easily understandable. If your users can’t soon find what they want, you will lose them very quickly.
Rapid prototyping: if you take a closer look at most websites with a gorgeous UX design, you’ll find that rapid prototyping tools were adopted by most of them. This approach lays a solid basis for a fast iterative development in the next stages of the websites building.
