Often our understanding of a problem is in context to how well we have explored and defined it. Various biases and personal assumptions may bear on that understanding. It is important to express a problem clearly and succinctly. Defining the problem is the most important part of the software development cycle. If the requirements and the parameters of the problem are clearly understood then the actual output of the development process is far more likely to meet the expected results. The first step in defining a problem is to fully understand the problem which needs to be solved. Since the developer is not the subject matter expert, there will be an initial period when the developer and the client must discuss the environment (domain), scope, inputs and outputs. Any processing of inputs into ouputs must be carefully detailed so that the developer knows exactly what to work with. This is basic software engineering. What we do in UX/UI is add the user psyche into the mix: understand the user from a motivational, psychology, emotional point of view.

In this course we don't spend a lot of time on Software Engineering since that is covered in other courses. When we speak of SE activities, it will be from a UX/UI perspective.
