User Context is the designer's understanding of where they came from; where they are; where they are going. To obtain this understanding you must place yourself in the user’s shoes and design the paths that he or she will travel. You must be aware and understand the thought processes, intentions, and what drives your user. To do this, you must build a model, or profile, of the user that can drive the UX/UI design of your web site.

Every experience consists of an event, a time, and a place. The event is a moment when the user interacts with the interface (moves a mouse, clicks a button, navigates to somewhere, etc. The time is relative to when the event occurs from the beginning of the user/interface interaction. For example, it is highly unlikely the user will want to check the cart for purchases, when first entering the web page. Of course, we mustn't preclude the ability to, since they may be returning to the page from a previous visit. The place, is the location within our web site. It may be that certain tasks (ex., log out of the account) need to occur at any place within the web site, not just at the purchase transaction completion page. Understanding the event/time/place nature of the experiences you are to provide the user will help establish the UX requirements for those experiences.

Past experiences shape future experiences and/or expectations. If I have visited a number of shopping sites which all had (metaphorical) shopping carts then I will likely expect a shopping cart metaphor on your retail site as well. The user context helps us to define the scope of these expectations due to past experiences.

A UX practitioner aligns, refines, and reconciles business goals with what a user needs. Where business goals and user needs converge should be the sole determiner of functionality. A business goal may be to increase successful completion of sales transactions. Locking the user in the checkout page until they complete the purchase, may lead to more completed sales transactions, but will likely cause the user to never return to your site. In the long run, your goal will not be achieved.

UX translates business, marketing, and technology solutions into meaningful experiences for users. To understand what experiences of the user will be meaningful requires that we understand the user and the context in which they exist while on our web site. Only after understanding a user’s context can you design her experience.
